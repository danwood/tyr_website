 Tomorrow Youth Rep has a dedicated staff that works tirelessly to bring youth opportunities to children.  But we can’t do it all without help!  Do you have time, talent, or resources that you can offer?
 </p>
<p>
   What you put into Tomorrow Youth Rep translates to a better experience for your children, and for the community as a whole.  So if you can make cupcakes to sell during intermission, or have skill with a hammer or knowledge of photoshop, or perhaps a van and a willingness to help us haul some sets, you can expand our potential and allow us to give your kids an even better experience.

</p>

							<h3>What are some ways I can help?</h3>
<p>
In oh so many ways.
</p>
<p>
  Every show we need hands to help us setup the venue, to run the house &amp; box office, and staff the snack bar. Whether you have some special skills or not, a few hours of time can be invaluable to us.
</p>
<p>
Interesting in helping out more directly with a show? We can certainly use your help.  Help in rounding up props needed for a show, or design and construct the sets or costumes is invaluable.  Another fun task would be working on a "bio board" to be shown in the lobby, showcasing the on-stage talent.
</p>
<p>
	<img style="-webkit-transform: rotate(-4deg); transform: rotate(-4deg);" class="snapshot floated medium-block opposite" alt="Creating the Les Miz poster" src="img/misc-poster-making.jpg" />
  And beyond the show specific tech needs, we rely on the kindness and enthusiasm of parents and friends to supply so many of the advertising and marketing ins-and-outs.  Many of our posters and show programs were designed by volunteers, almost all of our photos are taken by volunteers, and this wonderful website you are on right now is courtesy of one of our amazing parents along with many parent photographers.
</p>
<p>
  We could also benefit from administrative help if that is your interest.  Perhaps you have some experience or knowledge in the accounting arts and want to give us some time and pointers?  Or maybe you have some comfort or experience as a grant writer? — an area where we could definitely benefit from some help and guidance.
</p>
							<h3>Teen Interns</h3>
<p>
	In many of our shows, the experience for the kids has been enhanced by the presence of teenage or even pre-teen “intern” volunteers — often alumni of other TYR shows — who generously give of their time to help the younger kids with social games, blocking scenes, practicing their lines, and having a good time.
</p>
<h3 style="clear:left">Get in touch</h3>
<p>
  Any help, any skill, is so very welcome and appreciated.  We are here for the kids, and for the families — but we are so much more when parents and friends are also there as support for us.
